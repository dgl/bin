license so you can use them as you like, without warranty, of course.

## `ls -l`

* `dig`: A minimal wrapper for `dig(1)` that adds 256 colour terminal
  compatible colours. You might be interested in [dog](https://dns.lookup.dog/)
  instead, but this is useful when you really need `dig`.
* `wp`: Lookup entries in Wikipedia, using [Wikipedia over
  DNS](https://dgl.cx/wikipedia-dns)
* `throwaway-browser`: Run a new profile of Google Chrome.
